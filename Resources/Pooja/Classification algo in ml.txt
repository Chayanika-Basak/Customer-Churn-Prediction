Top 5 Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning
Popular Classification Algorithms:
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbours
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machines
1 - Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a calculation used to predict a binary outcome: either something happens, or does not. This can be exhibited as Yes/No, Pass/Fail, Alive/Dead, etc
  P(Y=1|X) or P(Y=0|X
It calculates the probability of dependent variable Y, given independent variable X. 
2- Naive Bayes calculates the possibility of whether a data point belongs within a certain category or does not.
            
3- K-nearest Neighbours 
K-nearest neighbours (k-NN) is a pattern recognition algorithm that uses training datasets to find the k closest relatives in future examples.




  



5- Support Vector Machines : 
A support vector machine (SVM) uses algorithms to train and classify data within degrees of polarity, taking it to a degree beyond X/Y prediction.
