Accuracy = Number of correct prediction / Total Predictions

Accuracy is a ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations.
Accuracy is the most intuitive performance measure.

True Positive: The number of correct predictions that the occurrence is positive

True Negative: The number of correct predictions that the occurrence is negative

F1-Score = (2 x Precision x Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

F1-Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall used in all types of classification algorithms. 
Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account. 
F1-Score is usually more useful than accuracy, especially if you have an uneven class distribution.

Precision: When a positive value is predicted, how often is the prediction correct?

Recall: When the actual value is positive, how often is the prediction correct?

Loss Function:   is a measure of how good your prediction model does in terms of being able to predict the e
xpected outcome(or value). We convert the learning problem into an optimization problem, define a loss function 
and then optimise the algorithm to minimise the loss function.

Optimization problem: Optimization is the problem of finding a set of inputs to an objective function that 
results in a maximum or minimum function evaluation. It is the challenging problem that underlies many machine 
learning algorithms, from fitting logistic regression models to training artificial neural networks.
