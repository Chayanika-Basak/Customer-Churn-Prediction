C. Quadratic Classifiers/ Quadratic Discriminant Analysis:

1. Definition: A quadratic classifier is used in machine learning to separate measurements of two or more classes 
of objects or events by a quadric surface. It is a more general version of the linear classifier.

2. Actual concept behind it:  in this individual covariance matrix is estimated for every class of observations. 
Uses Bayes’ theorem to calculate the parameters of the equations. QDA is particularly useful if there is prior 
knowledge that individual classes exhibit distinct covariances. 

3. Pros: The advantage of quadratic discriminant analysis over linear discriminant analysis and linear 
regression is that when the decision boundaries are linear, the linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression
 will perform well; when the decision boundaries are moderately nonlinear, quadratic discriminant analysis can give 
 better results.

4. Cons:A disadvantage of QDA is that it cannot be used as a dimensionality reduction technique. 
In QDA, we need to estimate Σk for each class k∈{1,…,K} rather than assuming Σk=Σ as in LDA. The discriminant 
function of LDA is quadratic in x: δk(x)=−12log|Σk|−12(x−μk)TΣ−1k(x−μk)+logπk

5. Accuracy: 84%
